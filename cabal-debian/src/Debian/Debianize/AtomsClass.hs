    -- ^ The cabal package description record
    | DHCompiler Compiler
    -- ^ The Compiler value returned with the Cabal

    | BuildDir FilePath
    -- ^ The build directory used by cabal, typically dist/build when
    -- building manually or dist-ghc/build when building using GHC and
    -- haskell-devscripts.  This value is used to locate files
    -- produced by cabal so we can move them into the deb.  Note that
    -- the --builddir option of runhaskell Setup appends the "/build"
    -- to the value it receives, so, yes, try not to get confused.

    | SourcePackageName SrcPkgName                -- ^ Name to give to debian source package.  If not supplied name is constructed
