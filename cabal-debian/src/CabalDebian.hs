-- | This is the main function of the cabal-debian executable.  This
-- is generally run by the autobuilder to debianize packages that
-- don't have any custom debianization code in Setup.hs.  This is a
-- less flexible and powerful method than calling the debianize
-- function directly, many sophisticated configuration options cannot
-- be accessed using the command line interface.
