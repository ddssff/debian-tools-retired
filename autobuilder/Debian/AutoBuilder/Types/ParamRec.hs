-- |An instance of 'ParamClass' contains the configuration parameters
-- for a run of the autobuilder.  Among other things, it defined a set
-- of target packages to build and a single build environment to build
-- them in.  (This typeclass and those belowe were used to transition
-- from a command line option based interface, they could probably be
-- replaced by records now.)  The methods are given in approximate
-- order of importance.
data ParamRec =
    ParamRec
    { vendorTag :: String
    -- ^ The string used to construct modified version numbers to identify
    -- them as part of your repository (rather than Debian's or Ubuntu's.)
    , oldVendorTags :: [String]
    -- ^ Additional vendor tags that should be treated as part of the local
    -- repository, and stripped when deciding the version number of the
    -- upstream source.
    , autobuilderEmail :: String
    -- ^ Email return address of autobuilder for use in generated
    -- changelog entries.
    , releaseSuffixes :: [String]
    -- ^ All build releases must have one of these suffixes.  When the
    -- suffix is stripped off the result is the corresponding base
    -- release.  We use ["-seereason", "-private"] for this value so
    -- we can build a public release based on any debian or ubuntu
    -- release, and a private release based on each public release.
    , buildRelease :: ReleaseName
    -- ^ The name of the release we will be uploading to.  It must end
    -- with one of the 'releaseSuffixes', and stripping off
    -- one of them results in the base release.
    , uploadURI :: Maybe URI
    -- ^ This URI is the address of the remote repository to which packages
    -- will be uploaded after a run with no failures, when the myDoUpload
    -- flag is true.  Packages are uploaded to the directory created by
    -- appending @\/incoming@ to this URI.  This is distinct from the
    -- local repository, where each packages is uploaded immediately after
    -- it is built for use as build dependencies of other packages during
    -- the same run.
    , buildURI :: Maybe URI
    -- ^ An alternate url for the same repository the @uploadURI@ points to,
    -- used for downloading packages that have already been installed
    -- there.
    , targets :: TargetSpec
    -- ^ The packages to build.  The 'Target' record includes the
    -- source package name, a string describing how the source is to
    -- be obtained, and a dependency relaxation list, a list of binary
    -- packages which normally would trigger a rebuild when they
    -- changed.  some methods for obtaining the source code of a
    -- package to be built.  See "Debian.AutoBuilder.BuildTarget" for
    -- information about the available target types.
    , doUpload :: Bool
    -- ^ After a successful build of all the targets, dupload all the
    -- packages in the local pool specified by the @uploadURI@
    -- argument to the corresponding repository.
    , doNewDist :: Bool
    -- ^ After uploading, run newdist on the remote repository
    -- incoming directory
    , flushPool :: Bool
    -- ^ Discard the packages in the local pool before building.  Use
    -- this when a bad package was uploaded to the local pool that
    -- you don't want uploaded to the remote pool.
    , useRepoCache :: Bool
    -- ^ Load the most recent cached repository information from
    -- @~\/.autobuilder\/repoCache@ and assume that it is still good -
    -- that no releases have been added or removed from the
    --,  repositories listed.  This is usually safe and saves some
    -- time querying each remote repository before using it.
    , forceBuild :: [TargetName]
      -- ^,  Build the named source package(s) whether or not they seem
    -- to need it.
    , buildTrumped :: [TargetName]
    -- ^ Build the named source package(s) whether or not they seem
    -- to be older than the version already in the repository.
    , doSSHExport :: Bool
    -- ^ Try to set up ssh keys if upload host asks for a password.
    , report :: Bool
    -- ^ Print a report of packages that are pinned or patched.
    , doHelp :: Bool
    -- ^ Print a usage message and exit.

    -- THINGS THAT ARE OCCASIONALLY USEFUL

    , goals :: [TargetName]
    -- ^ Specify a source package which we want to build, and stop
    -- once all goals are built.  If not given all targets are
    -- considered goals.
    , allowBuildDependencyRegressions :: Bool
    -- ^ Normally, if a build dependency has an older version number
    -- than it did on a previous build, it is an error.  This
    -- generally means the sources.list is incorrect.  However, this
    -- flag can be necessary if a package gets withdrawn from the build
    -- or base release.
    , setEnv :: [(String, Maybe String)]
    -- ^ Set one or more environment variables during the build, e.g. [_$_]
    -- @setEnv = ["DEBIAN_KERNEL_JOBS=5"]@.
    , dryRun :: Bool
    -- ^ This flag says not to do anything that will affect the
    -- outside world, such as uploads and remote newdists.  However,
    -- the files in @~\/.autobuilder@ may still be modified when this
    -- is used.  It does avoids making extensive changes to the
    -- local repository by exiting as soon as a target it identified
    -- as needing to be built.
    , showSources :: Bool
    -- ^ Print the @sources.list@ for the build distro and exit.
    , showParams :: Bool
    -- ^ Print the expanded runtime parameter list and continue.
    , flushAll :: Bool
    -- ^ Remove and re-create the entire autobuilder working directory (topDir.)
    , flushSource :: Bool
    -- ^ Discard and re-download all source code before building.
    , flushDepends :: Bool
    -- ^ Discard all build dependencies by copying the build environment.
    , flushRoot :: Bool
    -- ^ Discard and recreate the clean build environment.
    , verbosity :: Int
    -- ^ Higher numbers increase the amount of progress reporting.
    , topDirParam :: Maybe FilePath
    -- ^ Normally the autobuilder uses @$HOME\/.autobuilder@ for semi-permanent
    -- storage, use this flag to specify a different location.
    , createRelease :: [String]
    -- ^ Pass a @--create <name>@ argument to newdist to create a new
    -- release in the upload repository.
    , doNotChangeVersion :: Bool
    -- ^ DANGER!  Prevents any modification of the package's version
    -- number before building.  Normally a tag is added to signify the
    -- vendor and the base release of the package.  Using this option
    -- can lead to attempts to upload packages that are already
    -- present in the repository, or packages that are trumped by
    -- versions already uploaded to the release.
    , discard :: Set.Set TargetName
    -- ^ When any of these targets become ready to build, fail them.
    -- This is to save time on targets we know will fail.
    , testWithPrivate :: Bool

    -- THINGS THAT RARELY CHANGE

    , sources :: [(String, String)]
    -- ^ Specify all known @source.list@ files, associating a name
    -- with each one.  The names can be used in apt targets.
    , globalRelaxInfo :: [String]
    -- ^ A list of packages which will not trigger rebuilds when
    -- updated.  Used to avoid massive rebuilds when package which are
    -- build essential but are unlikely to affect the build, such as
    -- @tar@, are updated.
    , strictness :: Strictness
    -- ^ Specify how strict to be about the creation of build
    -- environments, trading off correctness with speed.  In all
    -- cases, a clean build environment is always maintained, and
    -- copied before the package build is performed using @rsync@.
    -- 'Strict' means the clean build environment is discarded and
    -- recreated before each target is built.  'Moderate' means the
    -- clean build environment is kept between successive runs, and
    -- updated as necessary using @apt-get update@ and @apt-get
    -- dist-upgrade@.  'Lax' means that build dependencies are
    -- installed into the clean build environment so that they
    -- accumulate across runs.
    , includePackages :: [String]
    -- ^ Additional packages to include in the clean build environment.
    -- Adding packages here can speed things up when you are building many
    -- packages, because for each package it reverts the build environment
    -- to the clean environment and then installs all the build
    -- dependencies.  This only affects newly created environments, so if
    -- you change this value use the flushRoot option to get it to take
    -- effect.
    , excludePackages :: [String]
    -- ^ Specify packages for build-env to omit from the package list
    -- even if they are marked essential
    , components :: [String]
    -- ^ The list of components of the base repository, for Ubuntu this is
    -- main,restricted,universe,multiverse.
    , ghcVersion :: Maybe String
    -- ^ Until we can get the code to look for the compiler version in the
    -- changeroot, we use this to tell cabal-debian what compiler we are
    -- going to build with.
    , developmentReleaseNames :: [String]
    -- ^ The list of upstream release which are currently in
    -- development.  This means we the tag we add doesn't need to
    -- include @~<release>@, since there are no newer releases to
    -- worry about trumping.  Debian's @sid@ is always in this
    -- list, along with the development version of Ubuntu.
    , releaseAliases :: [(String, String)]
    -- ^ Use these aliases for the release name when constructing the
    -- vendor tag used in the version number extension of built
    -- packages.  For example, including the pair @("hardy-seereason",
    -- "hardy")@ here means that packages built for our
    -- @hardy-seereason@ release will be assigned version numbers with
    -- suffixes like @0seereason3~hardy5@ rather than
    -- @0seereason3~hardy-seereason5@ (the latter would be an illegal
    -- due to the dash.)
    , archList :: [Arch]
    -- ^ The list of architectures to prepare the repository to accept.
    , newDistProgram :: String
    -- ^ Use given executable as the newdist program, the program that
    -- runs on the upload host to install packages in the incoming
    -- directory to the repository.
    , requiredVersion :: [(DebianVersion, Maybe String)]
    -- ^ Specifies the version of the library required.
    , hackageServer :: String
    -- ^ Hostname of the hackage server, normally hackage.haskell.org

    -- THINGS THAT ARE PROBABLY OBSOLETE

    , debug :: Bool
    -- ^ Unspecified debugging behavior.
    , extraReleaseTag :: Maybe Int
    , preferred :: [String]
    -- ^ When selecting build dependencies, prefer this particular
    -- package over other alternatives that could fulfill the
    -- dependency, even if this package seems older than some other
    -- alternative.  For example, the c-compiler virtual package is
    -- provided by @gcc-3.3@, @gcc-3.4@, @gcc-4.0@, etc.  If @gcc-3.4@ is
    -- in this list, a dependency on c-compiler will choose @gcc-3.4@
    -- over the others if possible.
    , buildDepends :: [String]
    -- ^ Obsolete?  Add a missing build dependency.
    , noClean :: Bool
    , cleanUp :: Bool
    -- ^ Do a garbage collection on the local repository, move all
    -- unreferenced files to @removed@.  This is probably not a
    -- useful option, as the local repository is frequently removed.
    , ifSourcesChanged :: SourcesChangedAction
    -- ^ What to do if the sources.list changes in the
    -- configuration directory.  The argument may be
    --
    --  * 'SourcesChangedError' - (the default) print a message and exit, [_$_]
    --
    --  * 'SourcesChangedUpdate' - rewrite sources.list and update the environment, [_$_]
    --
    --  * 'SourcesChangedRemove' - discard and rebuild the environment
    -- , emailTo :: [String]
    -- -- ^ Who should get emails of autobuilder progress messages.
    , packages :: Packages
    -- ^ The set of known package build specifications.
