  * In the Packages file, when there is a Source: field for a binary
    package which indicates that the source package has a different
    version number than the binary package, that version number has
    its epoch number stripped off.  This version copies the epoch
    number from the binary package into the source package version.

haskell-debian-repo (5.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use OldException from base-4 instead of exception from base-3.
  * Improve code to ignore dependencies that pertain to other
    architectures, I think this may only clarify the reporting, not
    actually change the functionality.
  * VersionPolicy module moved here from haskell-debian.
  * Escape the vendor tag when embedding it in a regular expression.
    (This function needs improvements, currently it only escapes the
    '+' character.)

haskell-debian-repo (5.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Because of the darcs patch "When running in a changeroot..." (from
    before this package was split out of haskell-debian-3), the process
    output when running in a changeroot always goes directly to the
    console, it can't be intercepted by the CIO module.  This change
    removes the code that was causing that output appear a second
    time after being saved in memory during the entire build.

haskell-debian-repo (5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a "twice" parameter to Debian.Repo.SourceTree.buildDebs to control
    whether we dpkg-buildpackage once or twice.  Some packages try to prevent
    fully automated builds by doing configuration and failing during the
    first run, and succeeding on the second.  Don't know why.
  * Pull in support for SHA1 and SHA256 checksums in the .changes file.

haskell-debian-repo (5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * When we run a process in a changeroot, make sure to force all
    the process output and the exit code before we exit the changeroot
    so we don't lose contact with the ssh agent before the process is
    finished.  When that happens we lose the ability to communicate
    with any remote host involved in the process and the process fails.
  * Move newdist from autobuilder into this package
  * Bump version number so this version of newdist trumps the ones
    from the autobuilder package
